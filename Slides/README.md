# GIGO: A Data Cookbook

üìö **From Students to Published Authors!** üìö

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce that this semester, my INFO 7390 students are embarking on a journey to not just complete a course project‚Äîbut to become **published authors** on **Amazon Kindle**! üéâ

They will be writing the first of **three books**, tackling the crucial question: *"I have a dataset, now what?"* This book will dive deep into transforming raw data into optimized data for machine learning and AI, covering everything from:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Handling missing data
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  
Each chapter will be packed with hands-on labs, real-world examples, Python code, and visualizations. By the end of the semester, their work will be **published**, making them official **Amazon Kindle authors**. This project not only showcases their expertise but also prepares them for their future in data science. üöÄ

Stay tuned for the launch of this amazing book series! üìñ

### Assignment: Transforming Raw Data into Optimized Data for Machine Learning and AI

#### Objective:
This assignment is designed to help students gain hands-on experience in transforming raw data into optimized data for machine learning and AI applications. Each group of students will select a specific topic related to data transformation, covering techniques that clean, structure, and optimize raw data to improve model performance.

#### Instructions:
1. **Group Selection**:
   - Students may work individually or form groups of up to **three members** to collaboratively write a **chapter** on their chosen topic.
   
2. **Topic Selection**:
   - Each group will choose a topic focusing on one of the key aspects of transforming raw data for machine learning. Example topics include:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing
     - Handling missing values (Imputation methods like KNN, MICE)
     - Feature engineering (creating new features)
     - Data normalization and scaling techniques (Min-Max, Z-score)
     - Data encoding for categorical variables
     - Handling outliers (IQR, transformations)
     - Data reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE)
     - Data integration from multiple sources
     - Techniques for dealing with imbalanced data
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Data visualization for quality assessment

3. **Chapter Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the topic and its significance in data science.
   - **Theoretical Background**: Explain the relevant theoretical concepts.
   - **Practical Application**: Demonstrate with real-world examples, datasets, or case studies.
   - **Graphs and Visualizations**: Include **at least 3 visualizations** such as graphs, charts, or diagrams to illustrate data transformations.
   - **Code Implementation**: Provide **code snippets** (in Python) that showcase the implementation of the techniques covered.
   - **Exercises and Labs**:
     - **Hands-on Exercises**: Develop at least **two exercises** where readers can apply the knowledge gained.
     - **Lab Activities**: Design a **lab session** with a clear dataset and objectives for readers to complete.
   - **Conclusion**: Summarize key takeaways and how these techniques improve machine learning models.

4. **Tools**:
   - The use of **Python** with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, or **Seaborn** is encouraged.
   - Provide datasets for exercises or refer to public datasets from platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - **Clarity of Writing**: The chapter must be well-organized and clearly written.
   - **Completeness**: All required components (theory, examples, exercises, etc.) must be present.
   - **Technical Depth**: The topic must be covered in sufficient technical detail.
   - **Quality of Code**: Code should be efficient, well-commented, and functional.
   - **Visualizations**: The use of graphs and visuals should effectively illustrate the data transformations.
   - **Hands-on Engagement**: The exercises and labs should offer meaningful, hands-on learning experiences.

#### Submission:
- Submit the final chapter as a **Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)** and an accompanying **PDF** or **Word document** that includes all content (code outputs, graphs, and narrative).
- Files should be named as `LastName_FirstName_GroupName_INFO7390_ChapterX`.

#### Due Date:
- The final submission is due by **[insert date]** at **11:59 PM** on **Canvas**. Extensions will only be granted under exceptional circumstances and must be approved in advance.
